# Tennis-Simulation
Text based simulation of a tennis match 

# Why??
This was an assignment for COSC-4331 Structure of Programming Languages. The professor really liked tennis. The focus was on developing the logic for the rules of a tennis tournament. There was a slight modification of the rules surrounding sets, I believe, to shorten the runtime a bit for the professor's sanity while grading. 

#When?
It's an older project. Cranked out in a rush before finals for the Spring 2023 semester. 

#A BIG APOLOGY
Sorry for including all of the classes in a single file. Nothing bothers me quite as much as grouping classes together like that, but that's what the professor wanted. I doubt I will be reusing any of these classes for anything, so I suppose it is alright. 

#License & Reuse
MIT license - Reuse all that you want. I don't require any credit, but if you're going to use it on social media a shout out would be appreciated.
